# Advent of Code
A repository for my Advent of Code workspace.

> [!NOTE]
> The files contained within `src/2023`, despite refactoring attempts, are still extremely unidiomatic, and best overlooked for now.

## Folder structure
Solutions are stored under `src/[year]/[day].rs` and correspond to their respective input files (`inputs/[year]/[day](-example)?.txt`).
